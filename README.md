# LEGO/STEM Club Challenge Tracker

## Project Overview
The LEGO/STEM Club Challenge Tracker is a database project designed to track children’s participation in LEGO and STEM kit builds, as well as club challenges. It allows tracking of:

- Which children completed which kits
- Completion dates and time taken
- Challenge participation and scores
- Overall performance metrics and summaries

This project demonstrates skills in **SQL, database design, data retrieval, aggregation, views, and functions**. It’s built in **MySQL** and visualized using **DBeaver**.

## Skills Demonstrated

This project showcases the following **SQL and data analytics skills**, along with screenshots demonstrating each skill:

### 1. Database Design & Management
- Created relational tables with primary and foreign keys  
- Defined relationships between children, kits, builds, and challenges  
- **Screenshot:**

### 2. Data Retrieval & Querying
- SELECT statements with filtering (`WHERE`) and sorting (`ORDER BY`)  
- Joins to combine data across multiple tables  
- Aggregations using `GROUP BY` and functions like `AVG`, `COUNT`

  - ![Aggregation / GROUP BY Results](screenshots/aggregation_groupby_results.png)  
  - ![Filtering / WHERE + ORDER BY Results](screenshots/filtering_where_orderby_results.png)

### 3. Data Organization & Optimization
- Created **views** to simplify complex queries  
- Used **functions / stored procedures** for reusable calculations

### 4. Data Integrity & Cleaning
- Handled duplicate entries  
- Ensured consistent data types and relationships across tables
