## NHS Patient Records Database
Project Overview
The NHS Patient Records Database simulates a small-scale NHS-style patient database. It allows tracking of:
- Patient demographics (age, gender, ethnicity, postcode, IMD score)
- GP practice information
- Appointment attendance and status
This project demonstrates skills in SQL, database design, data retrieval, aggregation, and basic analytics. It’s built in MySQL and visualized using DBeaver.
