## NHS Patient Records Database Project Overview The NHS Patient Records Database simulates a small-scale NHS-style patient database. It allows tracking of: - Patient demographics (age, gender, ethnicity, postcode, IMD score) - GP practice information - Appointment attendance and status This project demonstrates skills in SQL, database design, data retrieval, aggregation, and basic analytics. It’s built in MySQL and visualized using DBeaver. ## Skills Demonstrated This project showcases SQL and data analytics skills, along with screenshots demonstrating each skill. ## 1️⃣ Database Design & Management Created relational tables with primary and foreign keys: Patients, GP_Practices, Appointments Defined relationships between patients, GP practices, and appointments # Visuals: - ER diagram showing tables and relationships <img width="832" height="1148" alt="PatientRecordsDB" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93678e85-4b27-4f60-8010-e3dcd4a804e6" /> - Table view of Appointments table diagram & GP_Practices table diagram in DBeaver <img width="668" height="391" alt="AppointmentsTable" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f122822-1bd2-4cf1-9b8b-6986905ee499" /> <img width="724" height="421" alt="gpPractices" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c53494d1-e228-4459-a715-211de8a1beec" /> ## 2️⃣ Data Retrieval & Querying - SELECT statements with filtering (WHERE) and sorting (ORDER BY) - 1: Patients older than 40, sorted by age descending - WHERE Age > 40 → only patients older than 40 - ORDER BY Age DESC → highest age first <img width="526" height="293" alt="select" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d79ab430-a67a-47fb-a679-396fc475a1c2" /> 2: Female patients in postcode area 'LE5', sorted by IMD score ascending <img width="693" height="160" alt="SELECT2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e03b12c6-97c8-40ac-a1ec-6ae649092aff" /> - Joins to combine data across multiple tables - Aggregations using GROUP BY and functions like COUNT ## Visuals: ## 3️⃣ Joins to Combine Tables 1: Show patients with their GP practice name - JOIN links patients to their GP - Shows demographic + GP name in one query <img width="577" height="479" alt="joins1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac515296-fde6-4252-bec7-b5b6a814f91e" /> 2: Show patients who attended appointments with date and GP <img width="665" height="575" alt="joins2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eac4c64c-8123-4be7-8a93-791b21e5583f" /> ## 4️⃣ Aggregations with GROUP BY and COUNT 1: Count of patients per GP practice <img width="397" height="182" alt="aggr1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19237716-2593-4a06-83c5-88795d849531" /> 2: Most common gender among patients who attended appointments <img width="341" height="125" alt="aggr2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1b1bf7f-0b63-4f2b-9c72-83ccd44cc429" />
